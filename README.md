# YourRoute

This is a student project that my teammates with me did it during we studied in Hochschule Karlsruhe-Technik und Wirtschaft in 2016.

The target of the project is to find the best route for users on Openstreetmap for crisis routing (blocked areas, ...).


###General Description
- Offers spatial services, that have been created by several users 
- In those services free geographic data from OpenStreetMap have 
 been collected collaboratively 
- This data is based on open standards by the so-called Open 
 Geospatial Consortium (OGC) 
 (OGC is an international organization and the task of it is to 
 make quality open standards for the global geospatial community)
- Currently a service has been implemented within the frame, 
 which allows the user to include maps, but thereÂ´s also one for 
 geocoding and another one for routing in the appropriate web pages 
 or applications
- By requesting, accessing and using ORS and the provided API, the 
 user agrees to the appropriate terms of use
